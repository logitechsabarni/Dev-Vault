# DevVault - Secure Secret Storage Solution

## Project Overview

DevVault is a full-stack application designed to provide secure storage and sharing of sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and personal notes. It leverages encryption, robust authentication, and role-based access control to ensure that secrets are protected from unauthorized access while offering a user-friendly interface to manage vault contents efficiently.
